# ThinkStats-notes
notes from ThinkStats book

These are my personal notes from the ThinkStats book covering statistics and probability concepts with python, numpy, pandas, and other statistical packages. 

Through these concepts, I actively attempt to use commonly used techniques instead of the authorâ€™s code. 

Concepts covered: 
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Distributions
* Probability functions
* Correlation
* Hypothesis Testing
* Regression
